The project MscP3_Product_image_and_text_classificationn is a data scientist MSc student project.

The objective is to make a classification of products from a market place with their images and text descriptions.

 - The input files are NOT present into the Git. It consists into 1050 images. They can be dowloaded at

 They have to be put in the folder input/images/ and you have to remove the read_me file (present mostly to maintain the empty folder in github)
 - The code Market_place.ipynb takes this pictures and descriptions present in the flipkart_com-ecommerce_sample_1050.csv file to make a classification.
 - The temp folder will contains temporary  files produced by the code. in function of options it could be really long (18hours) so I have made files with punctual results to read if they are present and to compute if they are not. 
 - The python notebook is converted into HTML file Market_place.html available at :

 - The environment.yml contains the conda environment used.
